# App-Test-Gen

This project is a tool to generate test (.t) files for a given module. Given a module name, it will find all the subs and/or object methods in the file and output a a test file for the module. The more information found about expected results, the more tests it will attempt to write, but at the very least one test per sub/method will be created.
